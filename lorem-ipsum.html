        `Whenever I hear the song of a bird
        Or look at the blue blue sky

        Whenever I feel the rain on my face

        Or the wind as it rushes by

        Whenever I touch a velvet rose

        Or walk by our lilac tree

        glad that I live in this beautiful world

        Heav\'nly Father created for me

        He gave me my eyes that I might see

        The color of butterfly wings

        He gave me my ears that I might hear

        The magical sound of things

        He gave me my life my mind my heart

        I thank him rev\'rently

        For all his creations of which I\'m a part

        Yes I know loves me
        I looked out the window and what did I see

        Popcorn popping on the apricot tree

        Spring had brought me such a nice surprise

        Blossoms popping right before my eyes

        I could take an armful and make a treat

        A popcorn ball that would smell so sweet

        It wasn\'t really so but it seemed to be

        Popcorn popping on the apricot tree

        Once there was a snowman snowman snowman

        Once there was a snowman tall tall tall

        In the sun he melted melted melted

        In the sun he melted small small small
        Adam was a prophet first one that we know

        In a place called Eden he helped things to grow

        Adam served following his ways

        We are his descendants in the latter days

        Chorus

        Follow the prophet follow the prophet
        Follow the prophet don\'t go astray

        Follow the prophet follow the prophet

        Follow the prophet he knows the way

        Enoch was a prophet he taught what was good

        People in his city did just what they should

        When they were so righteous that there was no sin

        took them up to live with him

        Noah was a prophet called to preach the word

        Tried to cry repentance but nobody heard

        They were busy sinning Noah preached in vain

        They wished they had listened when they saw the rain

        Abraham the prophet prayed to have a son

        So sent Isaac as the chosen one

        Isaac begat Jacob known as Israel

        Jacob\'s sons were twelve tribes so the Bible tells

        Moses was a prophet sent to Israel

        He would lead them to the promised land to dwell

        They were slow to follow or so it appears

        They were in the wilderness for forty years

        Samuel was a prophet chosen as a boy

        Hannah promised her son would serve with joy

        In the tabernacle Samuel heard his name

        He was called answered Here I am

        Jonah was a prophet tried to run away

        But he later learned to listen and obey

        When we really try won\'t let us fail

        That\'s what Jonah learned deep down inside the whale

        Daniel was a prophet He refused to sin

        So the king threw Daniel in the lions\' den

        Angels calmed the lions and the king soon saw

        Daniel\'s powr was great for he obeyed law

        Now we have a world where people are confused

        If you believe it go and watch the news

        We can get direction all along our way

        If we heed the prophets follow what they say
        Singing a song is fun to do

        Fun to do to do to do

        Singing a song is fun to do

        To do to do to do

        Do as I\'m doing

        Follow follow me

        If I do it high or low

        If I do it fast or slow

        There\'s a light within me

        The perfect light

        And I have made a promise

        To keep it burning bright

        By walking in His footsteps

        And following His plan

        In every time and every place

        In every way I can

        One simple act of kindness

        Will lift a lonely soul

        One gentle word that\'s spoken

        Turns sadness to hope

        One choice

        Will spread the love He gives

        And one by one the world becomes

        A better place to live

        I will shine like a candle in the dark

        All it takes to make a difference is a spark

        And it\'s easy to see that the brightest I\'ll be

        Is when I let His light shine through me
        Queen Esther\'s story shows me that I can stand for right
        Elisha taught that angels protect me by my side
        Like David I can slay Goliaths in my way
        Like Deborah I can lead my friends
        scripture heroes of old
        As I learn and grow in faith strength
        With every step I take I will choose to serve
        Like Moses I find courage for God provides a way
        Like Noah I will listen to heaven and obey
        trust Job and live with love and hope
        Like Hannah hear me when I pray
        Caleb was brave
        Joseph forgave
        Ruth stayed
        Daniel prayed
        Jonah changed
        strength
        With every step I take I will choose to serve
        Give said the little stream

        Give oh give give oh give

        Give said the little stream

        As it hurried down the hill

        Im small I know but wherever I go

        The fields grow greener still

        Singing singing all the day
        Give away oh give away

        Singing singing all the day

        Give oh give away

        Give said the little rain

        Give oh give give oh give

        Give said the little rain

        As it fell upon the flow\'rs

        raise their drooping heads again

        As it fell upon

        Give then as gives

        Give oh give give oh give

        There is something all can give

        Do as the streams and blossoms do

        For others live
        I am a child

        And he has sent me here

        Has given me an earthly home

        With parents kind dear

        Lead guide walk beside
        Help find way

        Teach me all that I must do

        To live with him someday

        my needs great

        Help me understand his words

        Before grows too late

        Rich blessings store

        learn do his will

        Ill live with him once more

        His promises sure

        Celestial glory shall be mine

        If I can but endure
        Fair is the sunshine

        Fairer the moonlight

        And all the stars in heav\'n above

        shines brighter

        purer

        brings to all the world his love

        Fair are the meadows

        Fairer the woodlands

        Robed in the flowers of blooming spring

        fairer

        He makes the sorrowing spirit sing

        Beautiful

        nations

        Son  Man

        Thee will I honor praise and give glory

        Give praise and glory evermore

        Evermore
        I like to look for rainbows whenever there is rain

        And ponder on the beauty of an earth made clean again

        I want my life to be as clean as earth right after rain
        I want to be the best I can and live again

        know when I am baptized my wrongs are washed away

        And I can be forgiven and improve myself each day
        I lived in heaven a long time ago it is true

        Lived there and loved there with people I know So did you

        Then presented a beautiful plan

        All about earth and eternal salvation for man

        said he needed someone who had enough love

        To give his life so we all could return there above

        There was another who sought for the honor divine

        Father send me and the glory be thine

        chosen he came

        Conquering evil and death through his glorious name

        Giving us hope of a wonderful life yet to be

        Home in that heaven where Father is waiting for me
        How could the Father tell the world of love and tenderness

        He sent his newborn babe with peace and holiness

        How could the Father show the world the pathway we should go

        walk with men on earth that we may know

        How could the Father tell the world of sacrifice of death

        die for us and rise with living breath

        What does the Father ask of us scriptures say

        Have faith have hope live like his Son help others on their way

        What does he ask Live like his Son
        Rev\'rence is more than just quietly sitting

        thinking of Father above

        A feeling I get when I think of his blessings

        rev\'rent love

        shows in my words and my deeds

        The pathway to follow is clear

        I know in my heart

        Heavnly Father near`
