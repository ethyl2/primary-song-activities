# Primary Song Activities

https://ethyl2.github.io/primary-song-activities/

One of my hobbies lately has been to create websites to help my local children's organization learn songs.

I've found that it's been great practice for reinforcing and expanding my skills, as well as a great excuse to try making things that are
original, creative, and hopefully quite useful to others.

I've decided to start this repo to create an index page for the song pages, as well as to contain new pages.

If you have an idea for a song, please contribute to this repo and/or tell me about it!
